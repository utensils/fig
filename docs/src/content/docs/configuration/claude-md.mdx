The CLAUDE.md Editor lets you view and edit the instruction files that guide Claude Code's behavior in your projects.

## What Is CLAUDE.md?

`CLAUDE.md` files provide project-specific instructions to Claude Code. They can contain:

- Coding conventions and style guidelines
- Project architecture notes
- Build and test commands
- Important context about the codebase
- Preferred patterns and practices

Claude Code reads these files automatically and follows the instructions when working on your project.

## File Hierarchy

CLAUDE.md files can exist at multiple levels, and Fig shows them in a file tree:

- **Global** — `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (applies to all projects)
- **Project** — `<project>/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (applies to this project)

The sidebar shows which files exist (doc icon) and which can be created (doc with plus icon).

## Preview Mode

Select a CLAUDE.md file to see a rendered Markdown preview. The preview displays:

- The formatted content with headings, lists, code blocks, and other Markdown elements
- The file path in the toolbar
- A git status badge indicating if the file is tracked

## Edit Mode

Click the **Edit** button in the toolbar to switch to the text editor. You can modify the Markdown content directly.

When editing:
- The editor shows the raw Markdown source
- Click **Save** to write changes to disk
- Click **Cancel** to discard your edits

## Creating New Files

If a CLAUDE.md file doesn't exist yet at a given level, click the **Create** button to start a new one. Fig will create the file and open it in the editor.
