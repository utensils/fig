description: Validate your Claude Code configuration and find issues.

import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Fig automatically validates your Claude Code configuration and highlights potential issues, security concerns, and improvement opportunities.

<Aside type="tip">
Health checks are powered by Fig's [Lua plugin system](/fig/plugins/overview/). You can create custom health checks for your own projects—see [Creating Plugins](/fig/plugins/creating-plugins/) to learn how.

## Severity Levels

Health check findings are categorized by severity:

| Severity | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Security** | Issues that may expose sensitive data or create security risks |
| **Warning** | Configuration problems that could cause unexpected behavior |
| **Suggestion** | Recommendations for better configuration practices |
| **Good** | Positive findings confirming good practices |

## Health Checks

Fig runs the following checks:

### Security

- **Deny List Security Check** — verifies that appropriate deny rules are in place to prevent dangerous operations

### Warnings

- **Broad Allow Rules Check** — flags overly permissive allow rules that grant more access than necessary
- **Global Config Size Check** — warns if the global configuration file exceeds 5 MB, which may indicate accumulated data
- **MCP Hardcoded Secrets Check** — detects API keys, tokens, or other secrets hardcoded in MCP server configurations

### Suggestions

- **Local Settings Check** — suggests using `settings.local.json` for machine-specific settings
- **MCP Scoping Check** — recommends scoping MCP servers to specific projects rather than configuring them globally
- **Hook Suggestions Check** — recommends useful hooks based on your project configuration

### Good Practices

- **Good Practices Check** — confirms positive configuration patterns are in place

## Using Health Checks

Open the **Health** tab (tab 7, or **Cmd+7**) in any project's detail view. Findings are listed by severity, with the most critical issues first.

Each finding includes:
- A clear description of the issue
- Why it matters
- Guidance on how to resolve it

## Resolving Issues

Click on any finding to see its details and recommended resolution. Most issues can be fixed directly through Fig's configuration editors by navigating to the relevant tab.
