Hooks let you run custom commands when Claude Code performs specific actions. Fig's Visual Hook Composer lets you create and edit hooks without writing JSON by hand.

## What Are Hooks?

Hooks are event handlers that trigger shell commands at specific points during a Claude Code session. They're useful for:

- Running linters or formatters after code changes
- Logging tool usage for auditing
- Enforcing project-specific rules
- Triggering notifications or integrations

## Hook Event Types

Hooks are keyed by event name. Common event types include:

| Event | When It Fires |
|-------|--------------|
| **PreToolUse** | Before Claude Code uses a tool |
| **PostToolUse** | After Claude Code uses a tool |
| **Notification** | When Claude Code sends a notification |
| **Stop** | When Claude Code finishes a session |

## Hook Groups

Each event can have multiple hook groups. A hook group defines:

- **Matcher** — an optional pattern that filters when the hook fires (e.g., only for specific tools or file patterns)
- **Commands** — the shell commands to execute when the hook triggers

### Creating a Hook Group

1. Navigate to the **Hooks** tab in a project's detail view
2. Select the event type you want to hook into
3. Add a new hook group
4. Optionally set a matcher pattern to narrow when it fires
5. Add one or more commands to execute

### Matcher Patterns

Matchers filter hook execution based on the event context. For example, a `PreToolUse` hook with a matcher of `Write` will only fire before write operations.

## Configuration Storage

Hooks are stored in the `hooks` field of settings files:

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write",
        "commands": ["echo 'About to write a file'"]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Hooks from all configuration tiers concatenate — hooks defined at every level will run together.

Start with `PostToolUse` hooks for logging and auditing, then add `PreToolUse` hooks as you identify specific workflows to customize.
