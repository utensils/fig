The Settings Editor lets you manage Claude Code permissions, environment variables, and other settings through a visual interface instead of editing JSON files by hand.

## Permissions

Permissions control which tools and actions Claude Code is allowed to use. They consist of **allow** and **deny** rules using glob patterns.

### Allow Rules

Allow rules grant Claude Code permission to use specific tools or perform actions. Each rule is a glob pattern such as:

- `Bash(*)` — allow all bash commands
- `Read(~/projects/**)` — allow reading files in the projects directory
- `Write(src/**)` — allow writing to the src directory

### Deny Rules

Deny rules block specific tools or actions. Deny rules take precedence over allow rules when both match. Examples:

- `Bash(rm -rf *)` — deny destructive remove commands
- `Write(.env)` — deny writing to environment files

### Disallowed Tools

You can also completely disable specific tools by adding them to the disallowed tools list. This prevents Claude Code from using those tools entirely.

## Environment Variables

The Environment tab lets you manage key-value environment variables that are passed to Claude Code. These variables are available during Claude Code sessions and can be used by MCP servers and hooks.

Add, edit, or remove variables using the visual editor.

## Scope: Global vs. Project

Settings can be configured at three levels:

| Level | File | Scope |
|-------|------|-------|
| **Global** | `~/.claude/settings.json` | Applies to all projects |
| **Project Shared** | `<project>/.claude/settings.json` | Shared with the team via version control |
| **Project Local** | `<project>/.claude/settings.local.json` | Your personal overrides, gitignored |

When the same setting exists at multiple levels, the most specific level wins:

**Project Local > Project Shared > Global**

<Aside type="tip">
Use `settings.local.json` for machine-specific settings like API keys or paths that differ between developers. This file is typically gitignored.

## Global Settings

Access global settings by clicking **Global Settings** in the sidebar or pressing **Cmd+,**. The global settings editor has four tabs:

1. **Permissions** — global allow/deny rules
2. **Environment** — global environment variables
3. **MCP Servers** — globally configured MCP servers
4. **Advanced** — raw JSON view
