import { Steps, Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## System Requirements

- **macOS 14.0** (Sonoma) or later
- **Xcode 16.0+** (for building from source)
- **Swift 6.0**
- [Claude Code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code) installed and configured

## Installation

### From Source

<Steps>

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/utensils/fig.git
   ```

2. Build with Swift Package Manager:

   ```bash
   cd fig/Fig
   swift build
   ```

   Or open `Fig/Package.swift` in Xcode and press **Cmd+R** to build and run.

</Steps>

A Homebrew Cask formula is planned for future releases to simplify installation.

## First Run

When you launch Fig for the first time, you'll be guided through a five-step onboarding flow.

### 1. Welcome

The welcome screen introduces Fig and highlights its three core capabilities: project browsing, configuration editing, and MCP server management. You can begin the setup or skip it entirely.

### 2. Permissions

Fig explains which configuration files it needs to read and write:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `~/.claude.json` | Global project registry |
| `~/.claude/settings.json` | Global settings |
| `<project>/.claude/settings.json` | Per-project settings |
| `<project>/.mcp.json` | MCP server configuration |

Fig accesses these files through standard macOS file system APIs. No special permissions are required beyond normal file access.

### 3. Project Discovery

Fig automatically scans your filesystem for Claude Code projects. It checks:

- Projects registered in `~/.claude.json`
- Common development directories (`~/code`, `~/Developer`, `~/projects`, `~/src`, and others)

The scan looks for `.claude/` directories up to three levels deep. You'll see a list of discovered projects with their status.

### 4. Feature Tour

A four-page walkthrough covers:

- **Project Explorer** — browsing and navigating your projects
- **Configuration Editor** — editing settings with a visual interface
- **MCP Server Management** — adding and configuring MCP servers
- **Global Settings** — managing system-wide Claude Code settings

You can navigate through each page or skip the tour.

### 5. Completion

A summary screen shows how many projects were discovered. Click **Open Fig** to enter the main application.

## Quick Tour

### Opening a Project

The sidebar lists all discovered projects. Click any project to open its detail view. You can also use **Cmd+K** to open the quick switcher and search for a project by name.

### Viewing Configuration

Project details are organized into tabs:

1. **Permissions** — allow/deny rules with glob patterns
2. **Environment** — environment variables
3. **MCP Servers** — configured MCP servers
4. **Hooks** — Claude Code event hooks
5. **CLAUDE.md** — project instruction files
6. **Effective Config** — merged view with source attribution
7. **Health** — configuration validation results
8. **Advanced** — raw configuration view

Use **Cmd+1** through **Cmd+9** to switch between tabs.

### Making a Change

Edit any configuration value through the visual interface. Changes are saved to the appropriate configuration file. Fig automatically creates a timestamped backup before every write, so you can always revert.

### Global Settings

Click **Global Settings** at the top of the sidebar (or press **Cmd+,**) to manage system-wide settings that apply to all projects.
