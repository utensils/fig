Fig supports keyboard-driven navigation for fast access to projects and configuration tabs.

## Quick Switcher

Press **Cmd+K** to open the quick switcher — a modal search overlay for finding and opening projects instantly.

### Using the Quick Switcher

1. Press **Cmd+K** to open
2. Type to search by project name
3. Use **arrow keys** to navigate results
4. Press **Enter** to open the selected project

The quick switcher shows results organized by:
