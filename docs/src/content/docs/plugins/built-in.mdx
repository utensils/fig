Fig ships with three built-in Lua plugins that provide comprehensive health check coverage for your Claude Code configuration.

## Security Plugin

**Plugin ID:** `com.fig.builtin.security`

The security plugin checks for common security issues in your Claude Code configuration.

### Checks Included

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Deny List Security** | Critical | Ensures `.env` files and `secrets/` directories are protected with deny rules |
| **Broad Allow Rules** | Warning | Flags overly permissive rules like `Bash(*)`, `Read(*)`, `Write(*)`, `Edit(*)` |
| **MCP Hardcoded Secrets** | Warning | Detects API keys, tokens, and secrets hardcoded in MCP server configurations |
| **Global Config Size** | Warning | Warns when `~/.claude.json` exceeds 5 MB, indicating potential performance issues |

### Example Findings

**Deny List Security** triggers when your deny list doesn't include protection for sensitive files:

```
❌ .env files not in deny list

Environment files often contain secrets like API keys and passwords.
Add a deny rule to prevent Claude from reading them.

Auto-fix: Add Read(.env) to deny list
```

**Broad Allow Rules** triggers for overly permissive patterns:

```
⚠️ Overly broad allow rule: Bash(*)

Allows any Bash command without restriction. Consider using
more specific patterns to limit what Claude can access.
```

## Suggestions Plugin

**Plugin ID:** `com.fig.builtin.suggestions`

The suggestions plugin recommends configuration improvements to enhance your Claude Code setup.

### Checks Included

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Local Settings** | Suggestion | Recommends creating `settings.local.json` for personal overrides |
| **MCP Scoping** | Suggestion | Suggests scoping MCP servers to projects when only global servers exist |
| **Hook Suggestions** | Suggestion | Recommends hooks when none are configured |

### Example Findings

**Local Settings** triggers when no local settings file exists:

```
💡 No settings.local.json

Create a local settings file for personal overrides that won't be
committed to version control. This is useful for developer-specific
environment variables or permission tweaks.

Auto-fix: Create settings.local.json
```

**MCP Scoping** triggers when you have global MCP servers but no project-level configuration:

```
💡 Global MCP servers without project scoping

You have global MCP servers configured but no project-level .mcp.json.
Consider creating a project-scoped MCP configuration for better isolation.
```

## Good Practices Plugin

**Plugin ID:** `com.fig.builtin.good-practices`

The good practices plugin provides positive feedback about well-configured aspects of your setup.

### Checks Included

| Check | Severity | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| **Sensitive Files Protected** | Good | Confirms `.env` files are in the deny list |
| **Secrets Directory Protected** | Good | Confirms `secrets/` is in the deny list |
| **Local Settings Configured** | Good | Confirms `settings.local.json` exists |
| **Project-Scoped MCP Servers** | Good | Confirms project-level MCP configuration |
| **Hooks Configured** | Good | Confirms lifecycle hooks are set up |
| **Scoped Permission Rules** | Good | Confirms use of path-specific permission patterns |

### Example Findings

```
✓ Sensitive files protected

Your deny list includes rules to protect .env files from being read.
```

```
✓ Project-scoped MCP servers

MCP servers are configured at the project level for better isolation.
```

## Capabilities Required

All built-in plugins request the following capabilities:

| Capability | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `health:register` | Register health check functions |
| `health:findings` | Create health check findings |
| `config:read:global` | Read global settings for analysis |
| `config:read:project` | Read project settings for analysis |

<Aside type="tip">
Built-in plugins are automatically granted their required capabilities since they ship with Fig and are trusted.
</Aside>

## Viewing Health Check Results

Open the **Health** tab (**Cmd+7**) in any project's detail view to see findings from all plugins. Results are sorted by severity, with critical issues first.

Each finding includes:
- A clear description of the issue
- Why it matters
- Guidance on resolution (and auto-fix where available)
