Fig automatically discovers Claude Code projects on your system so you don't have to configure them manually.

## How Discovery Works

Fig finds projects from two sources:

### 1. Global Config Registry

Fig reads `~/.claude.json`, which Claude Code maintains as a registry of projects you've worked with. Any project you've opened with Claude Code will appear here automatically.

### 2. Filesystem Scanning

Fig scans common development directories for folders containing a `.claude/` subdirectory. The default scan locations are:

- `~` (home directory)
- `~/code` / `~/Code`
- `~/projects` / `~/Projects`
- `~/Developer`
- `~/dev`
- `~/src`
- `~/repos`
- `~/github`
- `~/workspace`

The scan searches up to **three levels deep** and skips common non-project directories like `node_modules`, `.git`, `vendor`, and build output folders.

## What Gets Discovered

For each discovered project, Fig records:

- **Path** — the project's filesystem location
- **Display name** — derived from the directory name
- **Existence status** — whether the directory still exists on disk
- **Configuration files** — which config files are present:
  - `settings.json` (project-shared settings)
  - `settings.local.json` (local overrides)
  - `.mcp.json` (MCP server configuration)
- **Last modified** — when the project's configuration was last changed

Projects are sorted by most recently modified first.

## Refreshing the Project List

Fig re-runs discovery automatically during onboarding. After initial setup, the project list updates when you relaunch the app.

## Project Not Found?

If a project doesn't appear in the sidebar:

1. **Check for a `.claude/` directory** — the project must contain a `.claude/` folder to be discovered via filesystem scanning
2. **Open the project with Claude Code first** — this registers it in `~/.claude.json`, which Fig reads
3. **Check the directory location** — if your project is outside the default scan directories, open it with Claude Code to register it in the global config

<Aside type="tip">
Projects registered in `~/.claude.json` are always discovered regardless of their filesystem location. The filesystem scan only supplements this list.
