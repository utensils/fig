The Project Explorer is Fig's sidebar, providing access to all your discovered Claude Code projects and their configuration.

## Sidebar Layout

The sidebar is organized into sections:

### Configuration

The **Global Settings** item appears at the top of the sidebar. Click it (or press **Cmd+,**) to manage system-wide Claude Code settings.

### Favorites

Projects you've pinned appear in a dedicated Favorites section for quick access. See [Favorites & Recents](/fig/projects/favorites/) for details.

### Recents

The last 10 projects you've accessed appear in the Recents section, sorted by most recently opened.

### All Projects

All discovered projects are listed below, with a count badge showing the total number. Each project row displays:

- A **folder icon** — blue if the directory exists, orange with a warning if it's missing
- The **project name** and an abbreviated path
- A **star icon** if the project is favorited
- An **MCP server badge** showing how many servers are configured (if any)

## Filtering Projects

Use the search bar at the top of the sidebar (placeholder text: "Filter projects") to filter the project list by name. The filter applies across all sections.

## Project Detail View

Clicking a project opens its detail view with eight tabs:

| Tab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Permissions** | Allow/deny rules with glob patterns |
| **Environment** | Environment variables |
| **MCP Servers** | Configured MCP servers |
| **Hooks** | Claude Code event hooks |
| **CLAUDE.md** | Project instruction files |
| **Effective Config** | Merged config with source attribution |
| **Health** | Configuration validation results |
| **Advanced** | Raw configuration view |

Switch between tabs by clicking them or using **Cmd+1** through **Cmd+8**.

## Context Menu

Right-click a project to access context menu actions:

- **Toggle favorite** — pin or unpin the project
- **Remove** — remove the project from the list (with confirmation)

## Bulk Operations

Fig supports selecting multiple projects for batch removal. Enter selection mode to check multiple projects, then remove them in one action.
