title: Favorites & Recents
description: Pin frequently used projects and access recent ones quickly.
---

Fig keeps track of your most-used projects through favorites and recents, giving you fast access to the projects you work with most.

## Favorites

Pin projects you access frequently so they always appear at the top of the sidebar.

### Adding a Favorite

You can favorite a project in two ways:

- **Context menu** — right-click a project in the sidebar and select the favorite toggle
- **Quick switcher** — open the quick switcher (**Cmd+K**) and use the favorite action

Favorited projects display a yellow star icon in the sidebar.

### Removing a Favorite

Use the same methods to unfavorite a project. The project remains in the main list but is removed from the Favorites section.

### Favorites Section

All favorited projects appear in a dedicated **Favorites** section near the top of the sidebar, above the main project list. This section only appears when you have at least one favorited project.

## Recents

Fig automatically tracks the last **10 projects** you've opened, sorted by most recently accessed.

### How Recents Work

- Recents update automatically when you select a project in the sidebar
- The most recently opened project appears first
- Once the list exceeds 10 entries, the oldest entry is removed
- Recents persist between app sessions

### Recents Section

Recent projects appear in their own section in the sidebar, between Favorites and the main project list. This section only appears when you have recent activity.

## Interaction with Search

When you use the sidebar search filter, it applies across all sections — favorites, recents, and the main project list. Matching projects remain visible in their respective sections.
