Fig includes several safety features to protect your configuration from accidental loss or corruption.

## Automatic Backups

Every time Fig saves a configuration file, it creates a timestamped backup of the previous version before writing. This happens automatically with no user action required.

### How Backups Work

- Before each write, the current file contents are saved to a backup
- Backups use timestamped filenames for easy identification
- Backups are created for all managed configuration files

### Restoring from Backup

If you need to restore a previous version of a configuration file, locate the timestamped backup file and copy it back to the original location.

## External Change Detection

Fig monitors configuration files for changes made outside the app (e.g., by a text editor, Claude Code itself, or version control operations).

### How Detection Works

Fig uses file system monitoring based on modification dates. When a configuration file is changed by another process:

1. Fig detects the modification
2. A warning is displayed indicating the file was modified externally
3. You're given options to resolve the conflict:
   - **Reload** — load the external changes, discarding your unsaved edits
   - **Overwrite** — keep your current edits and overwrite the external changes

### Symlink Handling

Fig resolves symlinks when reading configuration files and includes circular reference detection to prevent infinite loops.

## Undo / Redo

Fig maintains an undo history for configuration changes within each editing session.

### Usage

| Action | Shortcut |
|--------|----------|
| **Undo** | **Cmd+Z** |
| **Redo** | **Cmd+Shift+Z** |

### Scope and Limitations

- Undo history is per-session and resets when you close the app or switch projects
- Each undo step reverses a single configuration change
- Undo/redo applies to the currently active configuration view

## JSON Preservation

Fig uses custom JSON encoding and decoding that preserves:

- Unknown keys added by Claude Code or other tools
- Key ordering where possible
- Pretty-printed, sorted output for readability

This ensures that Fig never drops configuration data it doesn't directly manage, even as Claude Code evolves and adds new settings.
